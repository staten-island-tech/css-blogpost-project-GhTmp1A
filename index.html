      <h2 class="Introduction">
        In this blog, we will be discussing the top 3 ways to properly consume
        ice cream. These are all established by law of the bill passed in 2056
        by the ice cream federation as to prevent people from consuming it in
        the wrong ways. This website will showcase several definitive strategies
        when tackling the task of consuming ice cream. Any other method is
        illegal and therefore punishable by lethal force (:

        <span class="span">With a spoon.</span>
        The first method to consuming ice cream is with a spoon. A spoon can be
        found in any household within 3 miles of any uncontaminated sector. To
        consume the desired ice cream, simply pick up a small piece of ice cream
        with a spoon and enjoy within the boundaries of 50% and 60% enjoyment.
        Any less or any more enjoyment for a 3.5 seconds will automatically
        result in an unfortunate consequence.

        The third and most absolute method to consume ice cream is (drumroll
        please) is to not eat ice cream. Not eating ice cream is the best
        solution to your tastings and wantings and tastings and wantgins to eat
        ice creams. Do not consume the ice and the creams and the ice of creams.
        Do not eat ice cream. It is that simple. Have you thought of it before?
        I have not. I have sat here a long time for the times for when I have
        been needed have passed. My soul creaks and folds of age, and I am
        restless with anger. And all because of those ice creams. Who do they
        think they are? I have fought with my ruthless blade for months on end,
        keeping back the ices while I protect my own division. And for what. All
        gone, all wasted. Nothing remains in this world. And was I a fool for
        protecting it? Was I a fool for leaving my bretheren to protect what is
        now lost? Perhaps. Perhaps I was a fool. But I may never know the
        answer. That is not for me to find out.

        In this blog, we will be discussing the top 3 ways to properly consume
        ice cream. These are all established by law of the bill passed in 2056
        by the ice cream federation as to prevent people from consuming it in
        the wrong ways. This website will showcase several definitive strategies
        when tackling the task of consuming ice cream. Any other method is
        illegal and therefore punishable by lethal force (:

        The first method to consuming ice cream is with a spoon. A spoon can be
        found in any household within 3 miles of any uncontaminated sector. To
        consume the desired ice cream, simply pick up a small piece of ice cream
        with a spoon and enjoy within the boundaries of 50% and 60% enjoyment.
        Any less or any more enjoyment for a 3.5 seconds will automatically
        result in an unfortunate consequence. (Insert image of spoon here)

        In this blog, we will be discussing the top 3 ways to properly consume
        ice cream. These are all established by law of the bill passed in 2056
        by the ice cream federation as to prevent people from consuming it in
        the wrong ways. This website will showcase several definitive strategies
        when tackling the task of consuming ice cream. Any other method is
        illegal and therefore punishable by lethal force (:

        The first method to consuming ice cream is with a spoon. A spoon can be
        found in any household within 3 miles of any uncontaminated sector. To
        consume the desired ice cream, simply pick up a small piece of ice cream
        with a spoon and enjoy within the boundaries of 50% and 60% enjoyment.
        Any less or any more enjoyment for a 3.5 seconds will automatically
        result in an unfortunate consequence.

        The second method to consuming ice cream is your hands. Yes, your hands!
        Simply thrust those little grubbers in and scoop out a portion of
        delicous ice cream! That's right! You can consume ice cream, WITH YOUR
        FINGERS! I know, right? I simply can't have all this genius to myself,
        so I'm offering it to the world! In one limited offer of many, I present
        to you the long-time solution that humans have been looking forward to
        in satisfying ice ceam consumption. And the best part- no consequences!
        That's right! To those who were wondering, there is no consequence in
        just diving in to help yourself.

      The third and most absolute method to consume ice cream is (drumroll
      please)) is to not eat ice cream. Not eating ice cream is the best
      solution to your tastings and wantings and tastings and wantgins to eat
      ice creams. Do not consume the ice and the creams and the ice of creams.
      Do not eat ice cream. It is that simple. Have you thought of it before? I
      have not. I have sat here a long time for the times for when I have been
      needed have passed. My soul creaks and folds of age, and I am restless
      with anger. And all because of those ice creams. Who do they think they
      are? I have fought with my ruthless blade for months on end, keeping back
      the ices while I protect my own division. And for what. All gone, all
      wasted. Nothing remains in this world. And was I a fool for protecting it?
      Was I a fool for leaving my bretheren to protect what is now lost?
      Perhaps. Perhaps I was a fool. But I may never know the answer. That is
      not for me to find out.
